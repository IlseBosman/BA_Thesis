Bachelor thesis

In this repository, all used code for my thesis, where I examined the
influence of adolescentâ€™s personal characteristics on the likelihood of
successful survey response can be found. For structure, the repository
consists of multiple files. There is one file for sample and variable
determination (sample\_and\_variables). There is one file for inspection
of the data in terms of making tables for frequency distributions and
treating missingness (variable\_inspect). Finally, the last file
contains the logistic regression analysis + retrieving the coefficients
(logregmodels).
